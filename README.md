# online-scorekeeper
One of the many projects from webdevbootcamp course

It is a simple scoreboard that will keep track of 2 player's scores.

I added some functionality in the app like user can modify player 1 and 2's name by clicking on cutomize and typing their desired name and changing themes by choosing from the themes section. The background images changes depending on the chosen theme. If the user wanted the default version, user can refresh
